### Let's Talk About an Experiment

In this card, we are going to explore the different ways that we can expect an experiment to run.  

For example, if we where to say that our experiment is _flipping a coin_ then we would have **2** outcomes.  This in essence is our **Sample Space.**

A **Sample Space** is defined as: _the set of all possible outcomes of that experiment._

Why is this useful?  Well once we know **every** single outcome of an experiment, we can begin to understand the **probability** that a specific outcome will occur!

We can imagine a multitude of different probability spaces, below are some different sample spaces from the **same** experiment!

##### The Experiment:

Suppose that you draw a single card from a deck

- **Sample Space 1 (most  common):** The spaces consists of 52 outcomes 1 for each card in the deck

- **Sample Space 2:** The spaces consists of 2 outcomes 1 for red & 1 for black

- **Sample Space 3:** The spaces consists of 13 outcomes namely 2,3,4,5,...,10,J,Q,K,A

- **Sample Space 4:** The spaces consists of 2 outcomes, picture & non picture

These are just a few of the sample spaces that you can define from a single experiment, but it is impertinent that you define you sample spaces well, otherwise, probabilities are meaningless!

Any outcome or collection of outcomes in a sample space is called an _event_.  In the example where the only two outcomes are either **Black** or **Red**, each event has 26 points.  This may feel counterintuitive but as you explore more probabilities, you'll find this begins to make sense.  In the next card we will begin to explore what defines a probability space.

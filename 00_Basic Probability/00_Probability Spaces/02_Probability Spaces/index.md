### What is a probability space?

- Sample space: the set of all possible outcomes. For example, if you toss a coin twice, the sample space is {HH,HT,TH,TT}. The sample space is sometimes denoted by the Greek letter omega (Î©).
- Event space: the set of all events (can be zero to any number).

- Probability function, or the assignment of probability to the event. For example, the odds of tossing a coin and getting a heads is 50%. Probabilities are nonzero and add up to 1.

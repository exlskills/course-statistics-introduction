### Probability Spaces

The point of this course is to answer many questions that you may have about probability and statistics, but to start let's take a look at the following overarching question:


#### What are probabilities?

A probability is the measure of of the likelihood that an event will occur.  This means that we can put a number (between 0 and 1) that represents how often we see an event occur.  In this case 1 would be that the event occurs every single time, while 0 would represents an event that never occurs.

This may feel excessively basic, but understanding these key underlying premisses allow us to build an understanding of the world around us based on the likelihood that an event will occur!

### Cards in a Deck

Imagine that you draw a single card from a deck.  In this example we will assume our **sample space** contains **52** points.  One for each card.  With this in mind, we can begin to start to define probabilities for different events within our sample space.  

#### Probability of an Ace of Spades
The first step to defining this specific probability is that we must focus on our notation.  This may feel a little pedantic, but as we dive into more difficult topics, our notation will be very important in communicating.  

For this specific event the notation I will use is the following:

- **P(ACE OF SPADES) = 1/52**  

A good question here is where did I come up with the numbers 1 & 52?  Well our sample space contains 52 outcomes (1 for each card) and there only exists a single card in the deck that matches our conditions.  Therefore, the probability of choosing that card is 1 in 52 which is equivalent to 1/52.  

As the number 1/52 is in the range of 0 - 1 (or in mathematical terms [0,1]), it meets the requirement that all probabilities are bounded between 0 & 1.  

#### Probability of an Ace

Now this is a slightly different question as we are looking for **any** Ace rather than a specific Ace.  This means that we have 4 options out of the entire deck that we can choose.  **Our sample space is still 52 points as there 52 options we can choose.**  In this case our probability can be defined as the following:

Once again we can define this in the same notation that we used in the past.  

Probability = (Favorable Outcomes)/(Total number of Outcomes)

In this case the number of **favorable** outcomes = 4 & the number of total outcomes = total outcomes in our _sample space_ which is 52.  

Therefore the probability of choosing an **Ace** is 4/52 = 1/13 (after simplifying the fraction)

#### Probability of Card >= 10

In this case, we have **20** (This includes: 10's, J's, Q's, K's, and Ace's) favorable outcomes and 52 total outcomes.  (For the same reason as above) and therefore the probability of choosing a card that is greater than or equal to 10 is = 20/52 = 10/26 = 5/13 ~ .384


In the next example we will explore how these probabilities change if we are **not** using a _fair_ deck!

### Example 2: A Biased Deck

#### Key Assumptions for this problem

Suppose that the 16 face cards are assigned a probability of 1/32, while the rest of the cards are assigned a probability of 1/72.  This ensure the sum of the probabilities = 1.  This example would correspond to a deck of cards where the face cards are **far more** likely to be chosen than the non face cards.

#### Probability of Ace of Spades

From above we defined the probability of any face card = 1/32 and therefor that is the final probability for an Ace of Spades.  

#### Probability of Ace.  

In this case the probability of an ACE is equal to the sum of the probabilities of each one.

Therefore, the probability of an ACE = 1/32 + 1/32 + 1/32 + 1/32 as Aces are face cards.  This means the probability of an Ace = 4/32 = 1/8!


#### Probability Card >= 10

This is equivalent to the probabilities of the 10's + probabilities of the pictures.

In this case, our final Probability is: 4 * 1/72 + 16 * 1/32.  Nice!


#### Complimentary (Opposite) Events

Given event A, the **P(A) + (1 - P(A))** will always = 1

### Discrete Uniform Distribution

Right now we are talking specifically about **discrete** probabilities, but I would like to introduce you to a type of distribution.  A good example of this is rolling a dice.  Every outcome has the same probability & therefore we call if uniform.  The discrete values that the dice throw can take on are _1,2,3,4,5,6_ with each having the same probability of showing.  Assuming that the dice is **fair** each of these probabilities are 1/6.

We can also look at the **mean** and the **variance** of such distribution.  This gives a good intuition of what to expect when rolling the dice.  **In general we call this (the mean) the expectation value** and we will get into that more later on.  For now, lets just look at how to calculate the **mean** and **variance**

 you can also add code using triple ticks

 `or you can do inline code with single quotes`

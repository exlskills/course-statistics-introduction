### How to calculate the variance

Now that we where able to calculate the mean for the discrete uniform distribution, lets see if we can calculate the variance of rolling a dice. Since we started with the mean, it makes sense that we are going to use this in calculating the variance.

What is the **variance?**

- it measures how far a set of (random) numbers are spread out from their average value.

In this case

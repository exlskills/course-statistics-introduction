### Example 1

**1. What is the total number of 4 letter words that you can create?**

- Each spot in the 4 letter word can be filled with one of 26 letters, and therefore the answer to this question is 26 * 26 * 26 * 26


**2. What is the of 4 letter words that can be formed from 26 different scrabble chips?**
- The first spot can be filled 26 ways, the second in only 25 ways, the third in 24 ways, and the final (4th) letter only has 23 options and therefore our answer is 26 * 25 * 24 * 23

### Review:

We are going to start using some notation that you may be unfamiliar with: n!  To the untrained eye, this may just look like a letter with an exclamation mark. In mathematics, we treat the exclamation mark to mean factorial.  This is defined with the following:

- n! = n * (n-1) * (n-2) * .... 1

In the case n = 4, 4! is 4 * 3 * 2 * 1

- To make this work, we need to define 0! = 1

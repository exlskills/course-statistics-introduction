### Official Definition:
- A permutation is an arrangement of all or part of a set of objects, with regard to the order of the arrangement.

We will need to begin to use specific language to describe this. Here are some of the key vocabulary words that will help you describe permutations.

- **n distinct objects** is the total number of distinct object that you can place place
- **r at a time** is the the number of objects that will be placed.

The notation for this is _nPr_ where the _n_ and the _r_ refer to the above above definitions and the _P_ refers to **permutations**

The mathematical equation for a permutation is:

- n * (n-1) * (n-2) * ... * (n - r + 1) = n!/(n-r)!

A good example of this is:

**Given the five digits: [1,2,3,4,5] and we  want to create a 3 digit code.  Repeating the same number is not allowed, how many codes can we create?**


**Solution:**

Since repetition is not allowed, in this case n = 5, and r = 3.  So our equation becomes:
- 5!/(5-3!) = 5*4*3 = 60 unique codes!



#### Example 2:
**How many ways can the letters in GREEN be rearranged?**

- Total Number of Letters = 5
- Number of repeated letters = 2
- Number of ways **Green** can be rearranged: 5!/2! = 60!

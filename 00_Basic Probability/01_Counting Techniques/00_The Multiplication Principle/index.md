#### Suppose you have 3 shirts [Blue, Green, Red] and 2 pants [Checked & Striped] .  How many total options of outfits are there?

This is a very common problem and you can imagine that we will want to know the number of events in the sample space.  This is similar to the number of **combinations** that you can have for all of your events.  To put this more directly:

- If an event takes place in successive stages (slots), decide how many ways each slot can be filled and then multiply to get the total number of outcomes.

This means that in the case of the above question, the number of combinations is equal to 2 * 3 = 6.  In the next card we will take a look at a couple of examples for counting the number of permutations.
